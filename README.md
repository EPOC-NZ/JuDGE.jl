JuDGE stands for: Julia Decomposition for Generalized Expansion. Functionally,
it is a solver which leverages the syntax of the JuMP modelling language to
solve a particular class of capacity expansion problems.

Please see the [documentation](https://reganbaucke.github.io/JuDGE.jl/)
for details about installing JuDGE.jl, and examples showing how to set up a stochastic capacity example
model using the JuDGE.jl package.

For more details see our working paper: [JuDGE.jl: a Julia package for optimizing capacity expansion](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2020/11/8086.html).
